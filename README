Abaco: lame web browser for Plan 9, eternally a work in progress.
Plan9port version.

Build:
        If you have plan9port installed in a non-standard location,
        change sources accordingly. An easy way to do it is 
        sed -i 's|/usr/local/plan9|/where/is/plan9port|g' abaco/*.[ch]
	
	you can also build with -DSTANDALONE, which will use freefont
	in /usr/share/abaco (intended for p9p-less binary packages)

	mk
	cp abaco/passwd.6.font /usr/local/plan9/font/lucsans/
	
	check ./plumbing
Run:
	If you want a nicer antialiased font, put freefont into your
	conventional plan9port font directory and 
	cp abaco/abaco.fonts $HOME/.abaco.fonts
	You may modify this file to your liking without rebuilding abaco.

	See abaco.sh for what to do before running abaco itself.

Enjoy!
